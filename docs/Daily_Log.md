# Daily Development Log

### Day 1 (Oct 26, 2025)
- Created GitHub repository for MindPrint
- Added backend, AI, frontend, dataset, and docs folders
- Created FastAPI starter file
- Wrote initial architecture documentation
- Tomorrow: Gather and organize emotion datasets
  
### Day 2 (Oct 27, 2025)
- Created `/data` folder with dataset references  
- Added metadata.json file containing dataset info and emotion labels  
- Updated architecture documentation with data source info  
- ✅ Day 2 complete  
- 🗓️ Tomorrow: Plan dataset preprocessing (how we’ll clean & extract features)

### Day 3 (Oct 28, 2025)
- Added /analyze_text API route to backend  
- Created text_preprocessor.py in utils/  
- Updated requirements.txt (added nltk)  
- API returns mock emotion data based on text input  
✅ Day 3 complete

### 🧠 Day 4 – Emotion Model Prototype (AI Integration)

**Date:** 28 Oct 2025  
**Developer:** Muzammil Rehman  

#### 🏗️ Tasks Completed:
- Created `backend/ai_models/` folder.
- Added `emotion_model.py` file (dummy emotion detection model).
- Integrated AI model with Flask backend (`main.py`).
- Updated API to return predicted emotion from text.
- Verified repo structure and confirmed functional setup.

#### 🧩 Notes:
- Emotion model currently uses keyword-based logic.
- Will be upgraded later using a trained NLP model.
- System now capable of text-based emotion recognition (v1.2).

#### ✅ Status:
Day 4 completed successfully! The AI brain of MindPrint (text analysis) is now live.

### Day 5 (AI Model Integration)
- Updated emotion_model.py to include confidence scores.
- Integrated AI model with main API route.
- Verified API returns realistic emotion + confidence output.
